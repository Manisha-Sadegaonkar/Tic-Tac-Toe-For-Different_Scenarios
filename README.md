Project      			: Tic-Tac-Toe using python for,
                    i.	Base specification(2 Players) and Added BOT(1 player and Computer)
                    ii.	For BOTs as player 1 and player 2
                     iii.	Using Min-Max Algorithm and Alpha Beta Pruning between 1 player and BOT

Tic-Tac-Toe Using Python for different scenarios provided below are the project steps and description 

Level 1 and Level 2
Filename: TicTacToe_Level-1_Level-2.py
Level 1:
Description:
Using Object Oriented Programming Paradigm, developed Tic Tac Toe for 2 Player. When player wins as per the winning conditions it shows winner and game ends.If winning scenarios are not met then Tie will print on console monitor. To play again user need to rerun the .py file and provide inputs as positions.
Level 2:
Description:
Developed a Tic-Tac-Toe game for single Player Mode where the Computer plays against player. The computer places itâ€™s moves randomly in any open spot by referring the above Level-1 logic and developed a python script according to player Vs Computer scenario.

Level 4:
Filename: TicTacToe_Level4.py
Description:
Developed Tic-Tac-Toe for two AI Bots in which 2 AI Bots compete against each other. It Evaluates whether there is a win or a tie case.

Level 5:
Filename: TicTacToe_Level5.py
Description:
Developed Tic-Tac-Toe for player and computer using Alpha-Beta Pruning to make the Mini Max  algorithm more efficiently to play a game. After filling all the positions for player and computer, it decides a win or a draw case based on the winning conditions.
